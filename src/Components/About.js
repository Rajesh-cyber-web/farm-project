<br/>
I started Farmbox Direct with a vision of how food SHOULD be:
 fresh, and local (when mother nature permits). Having grown up in a family of farmers
  and living on a farm, I spent summers working at my uncle’s compost in the Midwest,
   learning how to live off the land, and the benefits of local and organic food! You
    could say the foundation of Farmbox Direct is in my blood!
After I became a mother I really began to pay very close attention to exactly what was in the
 food not only I was eating, but also what I was feeding my daughter. I was a busy NYC working
  mom, I didn't always have time to make a weekly trip to my local farmers market to pick up the 
  freshest and local,  items for my kitchen, I began to realize the true need for this service
I decided to step down from the corporate world, and go back to my roots! I personally hand
 pick every Farm, and Vendor we deal with! My goal is to bring you the Farmers Market in it’s
  purity to your door! I truly believe everyone deserves the right to eat healthy.

<br/>Dear Farm Boxers,
I wanted to take a moment to thank all of our incredible, loyal members.
 I started Farmbox Direct 6 years ago, and have always had the same goal
  of working to eradicate the food desert problem America faces. As you 
  may know, Farmbox Direct was the nation’s 1st company to adopt the “Food 
  as Medicine” mindset, and by partnering with a health plan, we have successfully 
  created FarmboxRX. This program delivers produce boxes to those who are suffering
   from chronic and diet-related illnesses. <br/><br/>
Farmbox Direct has always positioned itself as a grocery experience specializing 
in quality, farm-fresh produce. We will always believe that food is essential to 
life, and produce is essential to health. During times uncertain as such, Farmbox
 Direct holds our same core values even closer to heart, and we will continue to 
 work to bring our members colorful foods that support a healthy lifestyle. You can
  count on us to keep delivering tasty, fresh produce to your families’ homes during
   these times.<br/>
   As a world, we have faced much worse, and together, we will get through these times too.<br/> 
Stay healthy everyone,<br/>Ashley Tyrner - Founder- CEO Farmbox Direct FarmboxRx<br/>
